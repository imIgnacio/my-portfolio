      <h4>Full-Stack Web Development | 08.21 - 02.22</h4>
      <h4>Monash University Boot Camps</h4>
      <p>
        After several time working as web developer. I decided to take on a Boot Camp to keep up to date and learn some new features that 
        I might have not learned before. I learnt some extra skills I did not have, specifically in ReactJS and Redux. Also on the Back-End side I learnt
        GraphQL and extra skills in NodeJS. Here I also had a better understanding of how databases work and are structured, from SQL dababases to noSQL
        databases. How ORM are implemented and what advantages and disadvantages they bring.

      <h4>Computer Engineering | 03.18 - 12.19</h4>
      <h4>Universidad Catolica del Norte</h4>
      <p>
        I joined university when I was 18, since I was 16 I knew I wanted to be a developer, working in technology industry. There I learnt programming fundamentals and wrote my first lines of code in Python. Afterwards, I learnt OOP by
        coding in Java. In addition to this, I used Unity and C# to create my first Videogame.
